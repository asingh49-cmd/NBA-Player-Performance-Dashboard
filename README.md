## 🚀 Next Steps
This project can be expanded with several meaningful enhancements to improve analytical depth and unlock richer insights. Planned next steps include:

**1. Adding Player Positional Data**
- Integrating player positions (e.g., Guard, Forward, Center) will enable:
- Position-based comparisons
- Role-specific performance metrics
- Filtering dashboards by positional groups

**2. Incorporating Biographical & Demographical Attributes**
- Enhance player/team profiles by adding key physical and background information, such as:
- Height, weight, wingspan
- Vertical leap and athletic measurements
- Age, hometown, and nationality
- College or previous playing experience
- Additional geographical data to plot on maps

These attributes help build more context-aware analytics and modeling.

**3. Adding Historical / Previous Season Data**
- Including prior-season statistics will allow:
- Year-over-year trend analysis
- Player development tracking
- Momentum insights for predictive modeling

This will help expand the dashboard from a single-season view into a multi-year analytics platform.
