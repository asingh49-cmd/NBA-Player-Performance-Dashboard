Explore top scorers, all-around impact players, and player-to-player comparisons.

**Key Features:**
- Top 20 scoring leaders with interactive filtering
- All-Around Impact bubble chart identifying multi-dimensional players
- Player comparison tool with customizable stat selection
- Conference and division filtering

### 2. Team Profile and Performance Analysis
Comprehensive team-level analytics showing standings, performance metrics, and comparative analysis.

**Key Features:**
- Wins vs Point Differential scatter plot with trend analysis
- Team Profile Heatmap comparing all teams strengths and weaknesses across key statistics
- Interactive team standings with win percentage tracking
- Conference, division, and state filtering

### 3. Advanced Player Analytics
Deep dive into efficiency metrics, usage rates, and advanced basketball analytics.

**Key Features:**
- Usage Rate vs True Shooting % scatter plot with quadrant analysis
- Net Rating leaders identifying most impactful players
- Playmaking efficiency rankings (Assist-to-Turnover ratio)
- Adjustable filters for minutes, games played, and performance thresholds

## 💡 Key Insights

### Elite Scorer Identification
**Finding:** Players in the top-right quadrant of the Usage vs Efficiency chart (high usage rate >25% + high true shooting % >58%) represent the league's most valuable offensive weapons.

**Current Elite Scorers:** Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and Luka Doncic combine high-volume scoring with exceptional efficiency, making them MVP candidates.

### All-Around Impact Leaders
**Finding:** Players averaging 1.2+ impact per minute across all five major statistical categories (PTS, REB, AST, STL, BLK) while playing 30+ minutes are the true superstars.

**Insight:** Nikola Jokic leads with the highest all-around score (55+), demonstrating production across all facets of the game-not just scoring.

### Team Performance Correlation
**Finding:** Teams in the "overperforming" quadrant (high wins relative to point differential) often rely on strong clutch performance or defensive prowess not captured in basic metrics.

**Example:** Oklahoma City Thunder leads with both high win total and strong point differential (+18), indicating sustainable success.

### Playmaking Efficiency
**Finding:** Players with 4.0+ assist-to-turnover ratio while maintaining 5+ assists per game represent elite decision-making.

**Insight:** Point guards who protect the ball while facilitating at high volume are increasingly valuable in modern NBA offenses.

## 🚀 How to Reproduce This Project

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nba-player-performance-dashboard.git
cd nba-player-performance-dashboard
```

### Step 2: Set Up Python Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Collect Data
```bash
python scripts/data-collection.py
```

This will create 5 CSV files in `data/raw/` with current NBA season data.

### Step 4: Clean Data
```bash
python scripts/data-cleaning.py
```

This processes the raw data and creates cleaned versions in `data/processed/`.

### Step 5: Open in Tableau
1. Open Tableau Public
2. Connect to the CSV files in `data/processed/`
3. Build visualizations following the documentation in `documentation/tableau_calculations.md`
